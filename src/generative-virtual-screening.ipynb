    "## NIM Agent Blueprint for Generative Virtual Screening in Drug Discovery\n",
    "This example notebook demonstrates how to connect BioNeMo NIMs to carry out a few key steps of a virtual screening workflow. Importantly, these steps are powered by highly performant AI models in each category: AlphaFold2 for folding, MolMIM for molecular generation, and DiffDock for protein-ligand docking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we illustrate this workflow using an example protein and example molecule of interest, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and Nirmatrelvir, however, the user is free to define any protein and molecule of their choosing.\n",

    "All of these capabilities are enabled by NVIDIA NIM and NVIDIA NIM Blueprints. For more details, please visit [NVIDIA NIM Blueprints](https://build.nvidia.com/nim/blueprints). \n",

Here, molecular generation is powered by MolMIM, an LLM-inspired model aimed at generating and optimizing molecules according to user-defined objectives. The \"MIM\" part of MolMIM stands for Mutual Information Machine, which describes the mutual-information-based loss used to preserve chemical similarity in the model's latent space.\n",

By using this molecule as the input to MolMIM, the model will return 5 generated molecules with the highest chemical similarity to MolMIM. The user is able to specify the number of generated molecules to return when querying the MolMIM NIM.\n",

    "After obtaining the molecules with optimized QED scores, we can predict their binding poses to the receptor target. Here, we apply DiffDock, a state-of-the-art generative model that predicts the 3D structure of a protein-ligand complex, to find out the best (most probable) binding poses. A highlighted feature from DiffDock is that a presumed binding pocket, which usually can be characterized only from experimental 3D structures, is not needed (a.k.a., blind-docking). This feature is very useful for AI folded protein structures, as it is able to locate all regions on the protein surface to be bound by drug molecules, providing ingishts for further downstream investigations.\n",

    "The optimized DiffDock also provides the batch-docking function, by which we can concatenate multiple molecules into one request of docking, each of them will be also sampled for mulitple poses (i.e., num_poses=10 in this example). In the output, the predicted docking poses for each molecule is sorted by a confidence score that inferenced from a confidence model."
