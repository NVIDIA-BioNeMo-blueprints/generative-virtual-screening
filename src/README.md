### NVIDIA BioNeMo Blueprint for Generative Virtual Screening in Drug Discovery

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook showing a complete example. Check out the
[notebook](./generative-virtual-screening.ipynb) itself for more explanation of
how the generative virtual screening pipeline works.

Assuming you have already deployed the NIMs using the provided Helm Chart 
found in [generative-virtual-screening-chart](../generative-virtual-screening-chart), you should be able to start up a Jupyter notebook 
instance and get going immediately!

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
